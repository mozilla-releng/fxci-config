# This is the template for the task definition for cron task hooks.  Its job is
# to run a `mach cron` in a decision-task image; that command will take care of
# the details.
#
# This is parsed with JSON-e.  The context values are;
#  - level -- SCM level
#  - hookGroupId / hookId -- hook identifiers
#  - repo_env -- repository-related env vars
#  - checkout_options -- list of options to run-task to check out the repo
#  - project_repo -- repository URL
#  - alias -- project alias
#  - cron_options -- cron options (as a string)
#  - trim_whitespace(..) -- trim newlines and extra whitespace in a command string
#  - taskcluster_root_url -- the rootUrl for this TC deployment
#
# Note that aside from the task times as noted below, the JSON-e rendering performed
# when the hook is fired does not supply any additional information.
