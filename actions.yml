# This file defines in-tree actions, the roles that have access to them, the
# schema they accept, and the levels and trust-domains for which they exist.
#
# NOTE: the format of this file is not yet finalized and may change
#
# This file is a list of actions, each identified by trust_domain, level, and
# action_perm. Each stanza as a list of levels and action_perms to create for
# the given trust domain.  An action_perm is either "generic", which includes
# all actions that do not require special scopes and which can be triggered by
# all users at the given scm level; or the name of the action for anything
# else.
#
# The optional `input_schema` property gives the schema for the `user.input`
# portion of the hook's triggerPayload.  If not specified, the default is to
# allow anything in that field.
