# Create clients with a set of scopes based on the constraints given in the
# `for` block.

# Format:
# - client:
#     client/name:
#         description: client description
#         scopes:

# The `for` block uses the same format as the `Project` grantee in grants.yml.
# See the docstring in that file for a detailed description.


# Base clients for shipitscript workers. Only scopes which are needed by
