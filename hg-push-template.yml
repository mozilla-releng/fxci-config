# This is the template for the task definition for hg push hooks.  Its job is
# to run a decision task for the given revision of the given repository.
#
# This is rendered with JSON-e to create a JSON-e task template in a hook,
# meaning that the content of this file is rendered *twice* with JSON-e.  The
# context values for the first rendering are;
#
#  - level -- SCM level
#  - trust_domain -- project's trust domain
#  - hookGroupId / hookId -- hook identifiers
#  - project_repo -- repository URL
#  - project_repo_path -- path portion of the repository URL
#  - alias -- project alias
#
# Uses of `$${..}` and `$$..: ..` are intended to occur in the second rendering.
# The context for the second rendering is that provided by the hooks service in response
# to a Pulse message from exchange/hgpushes/v2 or a triggerHook call with the same payload
